# My Personal Project

## Phase 1

#### What will the application do? Who will use it?

I want to create an application where you can first gain "coins" by completing certain activity/actions, 
and then you can use these coins to purchase certain characters from *Sonic the Hedgehog*. 
You can then use these coins to power up different traits of the characters you purchased.

Ideally, the actions to be completed in order to gain coins will be complicated and fun enough to be like a game.
Perhaps things like a puzzle (sudoku? maze?).

The user can also view the characters with their different traits and how much it costs to power up to the next level,
what level they're currently at, etc.

#### Why is this project of interest to you?

I wanted to create this project because I play a mobile version of this game a lot and it's quite fun to always 
have a goal to work towards in a game (e.g. accumulating coins to power up a character).
I also don't really play games at all so I wanted to try and code one and see how it is like.
