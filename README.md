# My Personal Project

## Phase 1

#### What will the application do? Who will use it?

I want to create an application where a user will be able to obtain a random amount of "coins" which they can use to 
purchase certain characters of a game. 
The coins can also be used to power up different traits of the characters the user purchases.

The user can also view the characters with their different traits and how much it costs to power up to the next level,
what level they're currently at, and how many coins they have left.

#### Why is this project of interest to you?

I wanted to create this project because I play a mobile version of *Sonic the Hedgehog* a lot, and it's quite fun to 
always have a goal to work towards in a game (e.g. accumulating coins to power up a character).
I also don't really play games at all, so I wanted to try to code one and see how it is like.

#### User Stories

- **As a user, I want to be able to generate a lucky toss to obtain a random amount of coins.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to see how many coins I currently have.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to view all the characters available, and all the characters I own.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to add a character to the list of characters I own.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to select a character and view how much it costs to power up/purchase it.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to select a character and power up/purchase it.**
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of the application if I choose to do so.
- As a user, I want to be able to reload the state of the application from where I left off last time (if I saved it).
